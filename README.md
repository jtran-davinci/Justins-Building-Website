# PC Builder Website

This project of mine is a simple PC building website that does simple compatibility checks and is fully open source.
You can pick from a list of parts and plays audios of the part being installed.
When you finish, a performance calculation is made and returns your results.
My project isn't too advanced but it is for a school project.
